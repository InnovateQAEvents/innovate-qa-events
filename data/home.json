He served as a Technical Lead for company-wide Infrastructure for Integration Testing at Amazon for 6 years and held the same position at Google for 4 years.\n\nCarlos is passionate about Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and Core Developer Infrastructure for mid-to-large software companies. Having spent nearly three decades at three of the largest software companies in the world, he has seen firsthand how hundreds of thousands of developers write, review, test, and deploy code at a large scale. At these large companies, small inefficiencies can accumulate, leading to developer fatigue and the loss of millions—or even hundreds of millions—of dollars in productivity or wasted hardware resources. Carlos is dedicated to improving engineers' lives by removing toil, enhancing efficiency, and raising the bar in engineering and operational excellence.\n\nCarlos shares stories about his experiences at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft on his blog.
